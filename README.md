## DDEV Environment

DCE ships a [DDEV configuration](https://github.com/a-r-m-i-n/ddev-for-typo3-extensions), which allows you to test DCE in any TYPO3 version:

- 12.4

It uses Apache2 with php-fpm (8.1) enabled.

### Requirements

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- DDEV

### Setup

1. Start the DDEV containers using
    ```
    ddev start
    ```
2. Next execute the following commands
    ```
    ddev install-v12
    ```
3. On https://dce.ddev.site/ you get a brief overview of the environment


### Scripts

Besides the installation scripts, DCE also provides host commands in DDEV, to
render and preview the documentation.

**Render documentation:**
```
ddev docs
```

**Preview rendered documentation:**
```
ddev launch-docs
```
It only opens the browser with the right location. Please render the documentation first.
